# ACP (Advanced C Pre-processor)

Most of the important info is in project description :)

## Features:
 - Namespaces
 - Module system (just like in rust)
 - UXN compilation target
 - Fully C compatible

Example:
```C
import stdio as io;

pub int main(void) {
    io.puts("Very familiar with C, doesn't it?");
    return 0;
}
```
